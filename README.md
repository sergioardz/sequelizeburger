# Eat-Da-Burger
Homework Week 15 - Optional

## Overview
In this assignment, you're going to Sequelize the Burger app you made last unit. We've split this exercise into three different tiers, all with different tasks and expectations. Finish whichever tier will provide you with the most reasonable challenge.

### Tier 1: Sequelized! (Basic to Moderate) -- DONE
When you finish, your site should function just like your last one  

### Tier 2: Customer Associations (Challenge)  - NOT READY YET  
* Add in a Customer association to the project. This will involve creating at least one new Customer model and connecting it with your Burger model.  
* What kind of association you would like to use is up to you. Does a Customer have one Burger? Many Burgers?  
* For example, you could make a site that logs the name of which Customer ate which Burger, where each Customer only gets one Burger. If you can't think of another type of association, try this one!  

### Tier 3: Bonus! (Challenge) -- DONE
Add validations to your models where:  
* A burger's name cannot be null  
* A burger's devoured status is false by default  
* A Customer's name cannot be null  
Order the Burgers you send back to the user in alphabetical order using the Sequelize "order" option.  

### Bring your best burgers and try the site to devour them!

## Eat-Da-Burger details - What the project does  
* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.  
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page waiting to be devoured.  
* Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.  
* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.  

## Eat-Da-Burger's Purpose - Why the project is useful  
From a developer standpoint, Eat-Da-Burger wraps and reinforce the concepts learned during week 15.  

From a user standpoint, there is not much that Eat-Da-Burger could do for you, but to have some fun.
