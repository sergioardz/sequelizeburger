# Eat-Da-Burger
Homework Week 14

## Overview
In this assignment, you'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

### Bring your best burgers and try the site to devour them!

## Eat-Da-Burger details - What the project does  
* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.  
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page waiting to be devoured.  
* Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.  
* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.  

## Eat-Da-Burger's Purpose - Why the project is useful  
From a developer standpoint, Eat-Da-Burger wraps and reinforce the concepts learned during week 14.
